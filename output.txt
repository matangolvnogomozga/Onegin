The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;

[Enter Ghost, armed.]
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
But to recover of us, by strong hand,
So nightly toils the subject of the land;
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Do, if it will not stand.

As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Have you had quiet guard?
Bernardo has my place.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
To offer it the show of violence;
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
'Tis strange.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
Sit down awhile,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
Who is't that can inform me?
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
That, if again this apparition come
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
And liegemen to the Dane.
The bell then beating one,--
If there be any good thing to be done,
'Tis gone!
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
What, is Horatio there?
Who's there?
I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
For food and diet, to some enterprise
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
As it doth well appear unto our state,--
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Before my God, I might not this believe
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
As thou art to thyself:
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
And then it started, like a guilty thing
I have seen nothing.
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Is it not like the King?
Long live the king!
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
Not a mouse stirring.
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
Therefore I have entreated him along
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Without the sensible and true avouch
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
That can I;
ACT I.
O, speak!
Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
Last night of all,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
And will not let belief take hold of him
A piece of him.
